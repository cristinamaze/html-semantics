# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
Semantic HTML and CSS Consolidation 

In order to enhance the accessibility of a business solutions website, HTML semantics have been added alongside corresponding CSS. 
CSS from previous code has also been consolidated to reduce size and allow for clearer interpretation, comments have been added above such changes. 
Formating and design have not been altered from the previous code, per request. 
However, changing the color contrast in the paragraph elements on lines 69, 77, and 85 will significantly aid in accessibility as these are considered serious issues. 
Given this accessibility fault, it is my suggestion that these design choices should be altered slightly in order to be compliant.
